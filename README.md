This is a repository containing the assignments for the Computer Vision 2 master's course of the spring Semester 2017 at UvA


## Assignment 1
1. **ICP**: A custom implementation of the ICP (iterative closest points) algorithm
2. **Merging Scenes**: Apply the above ICP algorithm to estimate the camera poses between concecutive frames of a depth camera and merge their point clouds into a single scene.

## Assignment 2
Implement the Structure-from-Motion algorithm to recover three-dimensional structures from a sequence of 2D images
1. Implement the Normalized 8-point with RANSAC to compute the fundamental matrix given two images (with their SIFT features).
2. Chaining the images together
3. Structure from motion: Combine the projections of all points into a single scene
